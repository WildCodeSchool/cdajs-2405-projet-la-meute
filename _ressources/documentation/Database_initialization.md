# Database Initialization

At first launch, PostgreSQL requires the creation of a Database and its User. 

To achieve that, one can enter their docker container (`docker exec -it pawplanner-db-1 psql -U postgres`) then run several SQL commands to : 
```sql
/* 1. Create a user */
CREATE USER paw_planner_admin WITH PASSWORD '1234';
/* 2. Create a datase */
CREATE DATABASE paw_planner OWNER paw_planner_admin;
/* 3. Grant privileges to this user on this database */
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE paw_planner TO paw_planner_admin;
exit
```

## 1. Creating your PostgreSQL user

After you've run your first `npm install` command in root (manually or through the `npm run install:all` custom command), you'll have `dotenv-cli` installed as a dev dependency.

**dotenv-cli** allows the use of environement variables in the shell, meaning you can run commands with variables in them.

1. Access Postgres in Docker: 
```sh
docker exec -it pawplanner-db-1 psql -U postgres
```
2. Create your user: 
```sql
CREATE USER paw_planner_admin WITH PASSWORD '1234';
CREATE DATABASE paw_planner OWNER paw_planner_admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE paw_planner TO paw_planner_admin;
exit
```
These informations must match the ones in your `.env` and `Server/.env` files.
