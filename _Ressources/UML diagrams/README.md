# User Stories 

We used **Notion** to manage our User Stories. You can find our dashboard [here](https://www.notion.so/8e6cc84c5a444cbc9fd0de9b800348e2?v=b188190fdcb84d1bae9a8e8f79dbe23e).

# UML diagrams

The [Draw.io integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) extension was used to create those diagrams so we could keep it in project and track and save our progress on those diagrams.
